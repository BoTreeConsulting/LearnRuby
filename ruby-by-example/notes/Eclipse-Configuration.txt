1. If you have not installed ruby, please do that using 'sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1' for ruby,'sudo apt-get install irb1.9.1' for irb (the ruby shell). Check if its running properly and you are able to run ruby commands in IRB.

2. Download the eclipse plugin from following URL & install it in eclipse.
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyeclipse/
	
3. Create new workspace for ruby, create new 'Ruby' Project. This will ask to open 'Ruby' perspective.

4. Configure the ruby runtime, open Window->preferences->ruby->installed interpreters. This will show you jruby installed, but we need to add standard ruby vm. Click on 'add' and write '/usr' in "ruby home dir" field,  the first textbox. Select the new VM and click ok to set preferences.

5. As we do for java, we need to configure Run/Debug for Ruby as well to run any .rb runnable file. Any executable .rb file also can be run from here.
